# 3D-heat-equation-and-surrogate-modelling-using-XGBoost
This repository contains code to simulate the 3D heat equation in cylindrical coordinates, generate data for predicting the maximum temperature, and optimize XGBoost hyperparameters in Python to create a surrogate model for the simulation data
